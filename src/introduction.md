# Introduction

This online notebook is intended to serve as an auxiliary documentation resource. It will be used to collate resources and documentation on a variety of topics in different languages, libraries, and frameworks. The primary objective of this resource is to bring together useful information that is obscure, old, or otherwise difficult to obtain. Such information may still be useful, though it may be fragmented and and spread over the vastness of the internet on multiple sites such as forums and documentation archives. Where possible, usable examples of each topic will be included.
